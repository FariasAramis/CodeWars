Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:

             1
          3     5
       7     9    11
   13    15    17    19
21    23    25    27    29
...
Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle (starting at index 1) e.g.:

rowSumOddNumbers(1); // 1
rowSumOddNumbers(2); // 3 + 5 = 8

the table "nums" contains an integer "n", the number
return your result in a column "res"
